# HELLO

Hi Yueh-Chang Shieh,

This is my personal *Vimwiki* in my computer account 
`shiehyuehchang@strongstrong2` on *MacBook Air (M1, 2020)*. I use *vim* as my 
default productivity tool, and keep notes of everything using *Vimwiki*. 
For example,

* I can document your 
  [Application_Installation_Conventions_and_Configuration](./Application_Installation_Conventions_and_Configuration.html) of herein 
  computer account
* I can keep your note of associative required verification information of 
  computer, digital or bank accounts: [[SYC_Account_Info]]
* I can keep your notes of *Andes Technology*: [[Andes_Note]]
* I can bookkeep your expense and budget or have [[Financial_Plans]]   
* I can organize your [[SYC_Rules]] and [[To-do]] list
* I can organize my [[English_Learning_Note]]
* and so on...
	
Follows the working convention above, you get to organize everything with three 
pieces of information kept in your mind: 

1. Search for `~/SYCvimwiki/main_page.wiki` as the root of our notes in any 
   of our computer accounts.
2. Use `shiehyuehchang@strongstrong2` as our primary computer account on 
   *MacBook Air (M1, 2020)*. By enter the password to it, you get to access 
   our *Vimwiki*, which we recognize as the root of our *Vimwikis* and where 
   to start from.
3. The Passwords for all vim-encrypted wikis are the same as the login password 
   of `shiehyuehchang@strongstrong2`.
